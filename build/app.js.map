For example:\n\t *\n\t *                                            <Paper>\n\t *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n\t *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n\t *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n\t *                                            </Paper>\n\t *\n\t *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n\t *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n\t *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n\t *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n\t *\n\t *  <p>\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n\t *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n\t *  </p>\n\t *\n\t *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\t\n\t  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n\t    return {\n\t      beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t      afterElementType: 'div',\n\t      elementType: 'div'\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  render: function render() {\n\t    var _props = this.props;\n\t    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n\t    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n\t    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n\t    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n\t    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\t\n\t    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\t\n\t    var beforeElement = undefined,\n\t        afterElement = undefined;\n\t\n\t    beforeStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\t    afterStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\t\n\t    if (this.props.beforeStyle) beforeElement = React.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n\t      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(beforeStyle, this.props.beforeStyle),\n\t      key: \"::before\"\n\t    });\n\t    if (this.props.afterStyle) afterElement = React.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n\t      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(afterStyle, this.props.afterStyle),\n\t      key: \"::after\"\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\t\n\t    var props = other;\n\t    props.style = this.props.style;\n\t\n\t    return React.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t});\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 211 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tfunction _objectWithoutProperties(obj, keys) { var target = {}; for (var i in obj) { if (keys.indexOf(i) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, i)) continue; target[i] = obj[i]; } return target; }\n\t\n\tvar React = __webpack_require__(176);\n\tvar Paper = __webpack_require__(207);\n\tvar StylePropable = __webpack_require__(183);\n\tvar CardExpandable = __webpack_require__(212);\n\t\n\tvar Card = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'Card',\n\t\n\t  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\t\n\t  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n\t    return { expanded: this.props.initiallyExpanded ?

The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n *\n * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n */\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(\n    topLevelType,\n    topLevelTargetID,\n    nativeEvent) {\n  var shouldSetEventType =\n    isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder :\n    isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder :\n    eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = responderID || topLevelTargetID;\n  var shouldSetEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    shouldSetEventType,\n    bubbleShouldSetFrom,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n  EventPropagators.accumulateTwoPhaseDispatches(shouldSetEvent);\n  var wantsResponderID = executeDispatchesInOrderStopAtTrue(shouldSetEvent);\n  if (!shouldSetEvent.isPersistent()) {\n    shouldSetEvent.constructor.release(shouldSetEvent);\n  }\n\n  if (!wantsResponderID || wantsResponderID === responderID) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  var extracted;\n  var grantEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    eventTypes.responderGrant,\n    wantsResponderID,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n\n  EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(grantEvent);\n  if (responderID) {\n    var terminationRequestEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n      eventTypes.responderTerminationRequest,\n      responderID,\n      nativeEvent\n    );\n    EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminationRequestEvent);\n    var shouldSwitch = !hasDispatches(terminationRequestEvent) ||\n      executeDirectDispatch(terminationRequestEvent);\n    if (!terminationRequestEvent.isPersistent()) {\n      terminationRequestEvent.constructor.release(terminationRequestEvent);\n    }\n\n    if (shouldSwitch) {\n      var terminateType = eventTypes.responderTerminate;\n      var terminateEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        terminateType,\n        responderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminateEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, [grantEvent, terminateEvent]);\n      responderID = wantsResponderID;\n    } else {\n      var rejectEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        eventTypes.responderReject,\n        wantsResponderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(rejectEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, rejectEvent);\n    }\n  } else {\n    extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, grantEvent);\n    responderID = wantsResponderID;\n  }\n  return extracted;\n}\n\n/**\n * A transfer is a negotiation between a currently set responder and the next\n * element to claim responder status.

If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  propTypes: {\n    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var beforeElement = undefined,\n        afterElement = undefined;\n\n    beforeStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n    afterStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\n    if (this.props.beforeStyle) beforeElement = React.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(beforeStyle, this.props.beforeStyle),\n      key: \"::before\"\n    });\n    if (this.props.afterStyle) afterElement = React.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(afterStyle, this.props.afterStyle),\n      key: \"::after\"\n    });\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = this.props.style;\n\n    return React.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n\n});\n\nmodule.exports = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 210\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(obj, keys) { var target = {}; for (var i in obj) { if (keys.indexOf(i) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, i)) continue; target[i] = obj[i]; } return target; }\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Paper = require('../paper');\nvar StylePropable = require('../mixins/style-propable');\nvar CardExpandable = require('./card-expandable');\n\nvar Card = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Card',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return { expanded: this.props.initiallyExpanded ?
